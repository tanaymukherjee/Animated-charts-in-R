# Animated-charts-in-R
Till now we have figured some really cool graphing techniques, but imagine of you can make those graphs animate like a feature film.

In this exercise we will try to do exactly the same. Creat line graphs, scatter plots, bar charts, etc by animating the results for a particular paramter in the dataset.

The results are stored as a GIF and the same for each code has been added as a separate output in this repository.
